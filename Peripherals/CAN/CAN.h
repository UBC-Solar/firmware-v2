/**
 * This is the header file for the CAN driver.
 * 
 * The CAN controller configured will have no ID filters, and the
 * bit rate is set to 400KBS. 
 *
 * Polling will be required by the user, since the functions executed when CAN 
 * messages are received are too complex and long, and will not be suitable to
 * be placed in a interrupt handler (the alternative is to have the interrupt 
 * set a valid bit and poll that bit in the main loop. Unfortunately, clearing
 * the interrupt mask means setting the pending number of CAN messages to 0, 
 * which means, depending on the rate of messages being received, some messages
 * will be dropped.)
 *
 * Note: Please define the following fields in the main file 
 * (or any file that will include this header file):
 * - CAN_msg_t CAN_rx_msg
 * - CAN_msg_t CAN_tx_msg
